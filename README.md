# jeopy

**Jeopy** is a python project intended to scrape data from the internet and present it. The goal is to scrape data from [*J!-Archive*](http://j-archive.com/).
My only goal for this project is to learn.

This project requires the ```lxml``` library and the ```requests``` module. These can be installed with:

```
pip install lxml
pip install requests
```
