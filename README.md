# jeopy

**Jeopy** is a python project intended to scrape data from the internet and present it. The goal is to scrape data from [*J!-Archive*](http://j-archive.com/). My only goal for this project is to learn. The current topics for learning are HTML scraping and extending Python with C++.

This project requires the ```lxml``` library and the ```requests``` module. These can be installed from the command line with:

	pip install lxml
	pip install requests
